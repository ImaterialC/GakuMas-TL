<i>An English patch for Gakuen Idolmaster DMM version!</i><br>
<br>
</h2>

## <img src=".github/assets/fktn.png">Overview
This reposition is a fusion of two framework:
- **Localify** [GitHub Release v3.0.0Beta](https://github.com/chinosk6/gakuen-imas-localify/releases/tag/v3.0.0Beta)
- **[prebuilt Bepinex from Priconne Re:TL project](https://github.com/ImaterialC/PriconneRe-TL)**:
  - XUnity Auto Translate
  - Application resizing
  - Forced full screen (Alt+Enter)<br>
  
  
This patch builds upon Localify by adding crucial functionalities that were missing.

## <img src=".github/assets/hski.png">Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
- **Texture Translation:**  
  Extend translation support to include textures, which Localify does not cover.
- **Improved Variable Translation:**  
  Integrate Xuat’s translation method that, while not as polished as Localify in overall quality, excels in using regular expressions to handle the game’s numerous variables more effectively.
- **Implemet Auto Translation:**  
  Utilize multiple machine translation engines you can chose including SugoiofflineTranslate.
